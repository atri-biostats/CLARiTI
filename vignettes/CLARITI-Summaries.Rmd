The **Consortium for Clarity in ADRD Research Through Imaging (CLARiTI)** [@mormino2025consortium] leverages existing ADRC infrastructure to integrate standardized imaging and plasma collection to characterize mixed pathologies and use community-engaged research methods to ensure that â‰¥ 25% of the sample is from underrepresented populations (e.g., ethnoculturally minoritized, low education). 

The code below demonstrates how to use data in the `CLARITI` package and @R to derive some basic summaries.

```{r, child='../man/rmd/CLARiTI-Summaries-child.Rmd'}
